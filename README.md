Often times, database fields that are not assigned values are defaulted to `null`. This is particularly important when creating records with foreign key constraints, where the relationship is not yet established.

```php
public function up()
{
    Schema::create('profile_user', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->increments('id');
        $table->integer('user_id')->nullable()->default(null);
        $table->foreign('user_id')->references('users')->on('id'); 
        $table->string('twitter_profile')->nullable()->default(null);
        $table->string('facebook_profile')->nullable()->default(null);
        $table->string('linkedin_profile')->nullable()->default(null);
        $table->text('array_casted')->nullable()->default(null);
        $table->text('array_not_casted')->nullable()->default(null);
    });
}
```

More recent versions of MySQL will convert the value to an empty string if the field is not configured to allow null. Be aware that older versions may actually return an error.

Laravel does not currently support automatically setting nullable database fields as `null` when the value assigned to a given attribute is empty.

# Installation

This trait is installed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To install, simply add it to your `composer.json` file:

```
$ composer require dyrynda/laravel-nullable-fields
```

In order to use this trait, import it in your Eloquent model, then set the protected `$nullable` property as an array of fields you would like to be saved as `null` when empty.

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Dyrynda\Database\Support\NullableFields;

class UserProfile extends Model
{
    use NullableFields;
    
    protected $nullable = [
        'facebook_profile',
        'twitter_profile',
        'linkedin_profile',
        'array_casted',
        'array_not_casted',
    ];
    
    protected $casts = [ 'array_casted' => 'array', ];
}
```

Now, any time you are saving a `UserProfile` profile instance, any empty attributes that are set in the `$nullable` property will be saved as `null`.

```php
<?php

$profile = new UserProfile::find(1);
$profile->facebook_profile = ' '; // Empty, saved as null
$profile->twitter_profile  = 'michaeldyrynda';
$profile->linkedin_profile = '';  // Empty, saved as null
$profile->array_casted = []; // Empty, saved as null
$profile->array_not_casted = []; // Empty, saved as null
$profile->save();
```

If you want to extend this behaviour to _all_ fields on your model, you may do so by specifying `$nullable` as `*`:

```php
class UserProfile extends Model
{
    use NullableFields;
    
    protected $nullable = '*';
}
```
